# manifest-sandbox

The collection of repositories here are incubations for [OCI Distribution Spec] manifests. The current manifests are intended to support Reference Types, extending the capabilities of OCI Artifacts to support a graph of objects, including secure supply chain artifacts.

These repositories are staged here, with vendor-neutral [governance][governance], to incubate and ultimately donate to OCI, CNCF or another appropriate foundation.
